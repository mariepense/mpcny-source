### About Service

All students with disabilities who require special education services have Individualized Education Programs (IEPs). The IEP contains information about your child's interests, strengths, needs, goals, and educational program. It is a legal document that describes how the DOE will provide your child:

* A Free and Appropriate Public Education (FAPE)
* In the Least Restrictive Environment (LRE).


### Requirements

* 5 years old and up

### Direct SETSS

A special education teacher provides specially designed instruction part-time to
a group of up to eight children. This may be in the general education classroom
or somewhere else in the school.

### Indirect SETSS

A special education teacher works with the general education classroom teacher to:

* Adjust the learning environment
* Modify instruction to meet students’ needs
