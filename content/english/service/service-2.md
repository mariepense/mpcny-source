All students with disabilities who require special education services have Individualized Education Programs (IEPs). The IEP contains information about your child's interests, strengths, needs, goals, and educational program. It is a legal document that describes how the DOE will provide your child:

* A Free and Appropriate Public Education (FAPE)
* In the Least Restrictive Environment (LRE).


### Requirements

* 5 years old and up

### Direct SETSS

A special education teacher provides specially designed instruction part-time to
a group of up to eight children. This may be in the general education classroom
or somewhere else in the school.

### Indirect SETSS

A special education teacher works with the general education classroom teacher to:

* Adjust the learning environment
* Modify instruction to meet studentsâ€™ needs
