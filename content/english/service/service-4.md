A Special Education Itinerant Teacher (SEIT) provides specialized individual or group instruction and/or indirect services to preschool students with Individualized Education Programs (IEPs).

### Requirements

* 3 to 5 years old


### SEIT

A SEIT is a New York State certified special education teacher who comes to work with a preschool student with a disability on academic, emotional, and social skills.  SEIT services include both direct and indirect services. “Direct service” is specially designed instruction in which the SEIT works directly with a child, one-on-one or in a group (based on the IEP recommendation). Direct SEIT allows the preschool child with an IEP to benefit from the early childhood program and to participate in age-appropriate activities. “Indirect SEIT” means consultation provided by a certified special education teacher to assist the child's early childhood program teacher in adjusting the learning environment and/or modifying their instructional methods to meet the individual needs of a preschool student with a disability who attends an early childhood program.
