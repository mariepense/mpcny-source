### Testimonials

"The seits at the Marie Pense Center are compassionate and understanding to a
child's needs. The seits who worked with my son were interested in his future
and genuinely cared about his well being. I never felt like they thought it was
a job, rather they were partners in providing a positive environment for my
child inside the classroom and at home."

-- Jennifer Foler

"Nadia did good 'matching' for us in terms of matching our child's issues with a
SEIT, who had experience with that issue, was very caring, and had lots of
patience. After just a few weeks of the SEIT working with our child, he was able
show tremendous progress with his independence. Our child just aged-out of CPSE
to the CSE system and we wish we would have known about your agency sooner. Your
agency cares enough to do "check-ins" to see how the child-SEIT match is working
and to discuss the progress."

-- Rose G.

"The team at the Marie Pense Center has been part of our family for the last 3
years. Their professionalism and ability to take the time to understand not only
our childs needs but the overall family's has made this an enjoyable process.
They are committed to doing what's best for the child and we would highly
recommend their services to any family."

"We are so happy with our daughters' progress. We have been through many
agencies and finally feel we have found a great ABA therapist for our daughter.
We couldn't be happier with her progress." 

-- Suraiya B.
 
"The agency went above and beyond to help my daughter get the services she
needed. From navigating the system to finding a great S.E.I.T., we couldn't have
been happier with all the services the team provided."
